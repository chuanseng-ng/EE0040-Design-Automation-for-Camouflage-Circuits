Simulate:
  Redo/refine digital logic circuit simulator to be able to produce correct outputs for specific inputs at least 90% of the time
  (Regardless of number of logic gates present in netlist)

Camouflage:
  Remove output corruptibility re-calculator function
  If multiple gates are needed to be chosen, choose next best in list

Add-on:
  Create script to automatically convert standard libcell netlist to research libcell netlist
  
Attack:
  Remove pre-determined pattern and add user-based selection for camouflaged gate pattern
